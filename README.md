`GCRCatalogs` is a Python package that serves as a repository of various
galaxy catalogs and sky catalogs for the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC).
It provides a unified user interface to access all catalogs by using
the [Generic Catalog Reader (GCR)](https://github.com/yymao/generic-catalog-reader) base class.

This package is also used by the [DESCQA](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/descqa)
validation framework, and the concept and description of this reader interface
can be found in the [DESCQA paper](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4365/aaa6c3)
and also the [GCR repo](https://github.com/yymao/generic-catalog-reader).

The instructions below are intended for DESC members.
**If you are using public DESC data sets with `GCRCatalogs`, please follow the instructions on the [DESC Data Portal: data.lsstdesc.org](https://data.lsstdesc.org).**

## Available Catalogs

Below is a list of most-used catalogs. To find a complete, most up-to-date list of all available catalogs,
run the following code:

```python
import GCRCatalogs

# List all catalogs that are recommended for general consumption
GCRCatalogs.get_available_catalog_names()

# List all catalogs, including those may not be intended for general consumption
GCRCatalogs.get_available_catalog_names(include_default_only=False)

# List all catalogs whose names contain the word "object"
GCRCatalogs.get_available_catalog_names(include_default_only=False, name_contains="object")

# List all catalogs whose names start with the word "buzzard"
GCRCatalogs.get_available_catalog_names(include_default_only=False, name_startswith="buzzard")
```

(*Note*: remove `False` in the above line to only see recommended catalogs.)

Each catalog is specified by a YAML config file,
which can be found [here](GCRCatalogs/catalog_configs).

products of DESC Data Challenge 2 at the

## Using GCRCatalogs at NERSC

All catalogs available in `GCRCatalogs` are physically located at NERSC
(most are mirrored at IN2P3-CC as well).
At NERSC, you need to be in the `lsst` user group to access them.
You can find instructions about getting a NERSC account and joining `lsst` group
at [this Confluence page](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/x/mgRTD)
(*DESC members only*).

### With Jupyter notebooks

It is recommended that you first install DESC-specific kernels for your
NERSC jupyter environment (*you only need to do this once*).
To do so, log in to cori.nersc.gov and run:
```bash
source /global/common/software/lsst/common/miniconda/kernels/setup.sh
```
Detailed instructions can also be found at [this Confluence page](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/x/1_ubDQ)
(*DESC members only*).

Then, you can [start a NERSC notebook server](https://jupyter.nersc.gov)
and open a notebook with the `desc-python` or `desc-stack` kernel.
`GCRCatalogs` and necessary dependencies are already installed in these two kernels.
You can check if it works simply by running:

```python
import GCRCatalogs
```

If you don't have these DESC-specific kernels installed, you can modify
`sys.path` at run time (*not recommended*).
At the very first cell of your notebook, run:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/global/common/software/lsst/common/miniconda/current/lib/python3.6/site-packages')
```

### In a terminal or in a Python script

You can activate DESC Python environment by running the following line on NERSC
(needs to be in `bash` or `zsh`):

```bash
source /global/common/software/lsst/common/miniconda/setup_current_python.sh
```

If you want to use `GCRCatalogs` in a Python script, you can either activate DESC
Python environment before you run the script, or edit the hashbang line of the script to be:

```bash
#!/global/common/software/lsst/common/miniconda/current/envs/stack/bin/python
```

### Using the latest version of GCRCatalogs

If you need to use a newer version of `GCRCatalogs` than the one installed in the DESC Python environment,
here's what you need to do:

1. Clone this repo (on a NERSC machine):
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:LSSTDESC/gcr-catalogs.git
   ```
   (Note that if you want to use a PR, you need to clone the corresponding branch.)

2. Add the path to `sys.path` in your notebook.
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/cloned/gcr-catalogs')
   ```
   (Note that if you use `sys.path` for the DESC Python environment, you should add the line above *right after* you insert the DESC Python environment.)

If you are running DESCQA and want to use your cloned `GCRCatalogs`, you can add the path to `-p` option:
```bash
./run_master.sh -t <tests> -c <catalogs> -p /path/to/cloned/gcr-catalogs
```
See [more instrcutions for DESCQA here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/descqa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#master-script-options).

`GCRCatalogs` is also pip-installable, in case you need to install,
say the master branch of `GCRCatalogs` in your own Python environment
(*no, in most cases you don't need this*):
```bash
pip install https://github.com/LSSTDESC/gcr-catalogs/archive/master.zip
```

## Usage and Examples

Here's the very basic usage of `GCRCatalogs`.
Scroll down to see the example notebooks and more advanced usages.

```python
import GCRCatalogs

# see all available catalogs
print(GCRCatalogs.get_available_catalogs(names_only=True))

# load a catalog
catalog = GCRCatalogs.load_catalog('protoDC2')

# load a catalog with runtime custom options
# (one needs to check catalog configs to know the keywords)
catalog = GCRCatalogs.load_catalog('cosmoDC2_v1.1.4_image', config_overwrite={'healpix_pixels': [8786, 8787, 8788]})
catalog = GCRCatalogs.load_catalog('dc2_object_run2.2i_dr6', config_overwrite={'tracts': [3638, 3639, 3640])

# see all available quantities
print(sorted(catalog.list_all_quantities()))

# load quantities
data = catalog.get_quantities(['ra', 'dec'])
```

- You can find quantity definitions in [`GCRCatalogs/SCHEMA.md`](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/gcr-catalogs/blob/master/GCRCatalogs/SCHEMA.md).

- See [this notebook](examples/GCRCatalogs%20Demo.ipynb) for a detailed tutorial on how to use `GCRCatalogs`.

- See [this notebook](examples/CompositeReader%20example.ipynb) for a example of using the composite catalog feature.

- See [this notebook](examples/CLF%20Test.ipynb) for an actual application (the Conditional Luminosity Function test) using GCR Catalogs. (Thanks to Joe DeRose for providing the CLF test example!)

- You can find more tutorial notebooks that use `GCRCatalogs` in [`LSSTDESC/DC2-analysis`](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2-analysis/tree/master/tutorials).
