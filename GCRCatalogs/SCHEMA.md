# Schema of GCR Catalogs as used in LSST DESC

## Metadata

Attribute name | Type | Definition
--- | --- | ---
`version` | `str` | catalog version
`cosmology` | `astropy.cosmology` | cosmology of the mock catalog
`halo_mass_def` | `str` | halo mass definition, e.g., `vir`, `200m`, `200c`
`lightcone` | `bool` | whether or not the catalog is a light cone catalog

## Schema

- Label names are generally in `lowercase_separated_by_underscores` format, except in a few cases an upper case letter is needed (e.g., `Mag_true_Y_lsst_z0`).
- Label names generally start with the name of the physical quantity, and are followed by specifications (i.e., use `size_disk_true` not `true_disk_size`). Some exceptions are `galaxy_id`, `halo_id`, `halo_mass`.
- A quantity with `_true` usually means before the lensing effect is taken into account.
- Not all quantities listed below are available in all catalogs. Use `list_all_quantities()` to find available quantities.
- In addition to the quantities listed below, there are also *native quantities*, which are quantities whose label names and/or units have not been homogenized and may change in the future. Nevertheless, one can still access native quantities via GCRCatalogs. Use `list_all_native_quantities()` to find available native quantities.

## Schema for DC2 Coadd Catalogs

The schema for DC2 Coadd Catalogs follow the following rules:

- For quantities that are defined in [LSST DPDD](https://lse-163.lsst.io/dpdd.pdf), we follow DPDD's naming scheme.
- For quantities that are defined the above "Schema for Extragalatic Catalogs", we follow Extragalatic Catalogs' naming scheme ('GCRbase' below).
- For quantities that are defined in both, we provide aliases so both naming schemes would work.
- For quantities that are defined in neither and are newly defined for the coadd catalogs, we generally follow Extragalatic Catalogs' naming style.

For quantities that are not yet documented in the table above, we document them below:
- In the table below we list the name of the quantity, its units and definition and whether the name is defined in the GCRbase or DPDD.
- Items marked with 'xx' are not exactly defined in the DPDD, but their name is taken from a related column in a different table.  E.g.
   * there is no `x`, `y` in the DPDD Object table, but these are called `x`, '`y` in the DPDD Source table.  We don't have `xyCov` so we separately list `xErr` and `yErr`.
   * `radec` is a pair in the DPDD, but we separate out into `ra`, `dec` here.
   * The DPDD says `psCov`, but we only have the diagonal terms, so we call it `psErr`.
