# Schema of GCR Catalogs as used in LSST DESC

## Metadata

Attribute name | Type | Definition
--- | --- | ---
`version` | `str` | catalog version
`cosmology` | `astropy.cosmology` | cosmology of the mock catalog
`halo_mass_def` | `str` | halo mass definition, e.g., `vir`, `200m`, `200c`
`lightcone` | `bool` | whether or not the catalog is a light cone catalog

## Galaxy properties

- Label names are generally in `lowercase_separated_by_underscores` format, except in a few cases an upper case letter is needed (e.g., `Mag_true_Y_lsst_z0`).
- Label names generally start with the name of the physical quantity, and are followed by specifications (i.e., use `size_disk_true` not `true_disk_size`). Some exceptions are `galaxy_id`, `halo_id`, `halo_mass`.
- A quantity with `_true` usually means before the lensing effect is taken into account.
- Not all quantities listed below are available in all catalogs. Use `list_all_quantities()` to find available quantities.
- In addition to the quantities listed below, there are also *native quantities*, which are quantities whose label names and/or units have not been homogenized and may change in the future. Nevertheless, one can still access native quantities via GCRCatalogs. Use `list_all_native_quantities()` to find available native quantities.
