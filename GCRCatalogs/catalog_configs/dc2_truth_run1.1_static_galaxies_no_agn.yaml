    Truth catalog for proto-dc2 run 1.1 (corresponding to proto-dc2_v2.1.2).
    This is a truth catalog for galaxies only.
    There are no stars, supernovae, or galaxies that have AGNs.
    Reported AGN magnitudes are the baseline magnitudes on top of which the
    variability model is layered.  This truth information was generated with
    version 2.1.2 of the proto-DC2 extragalactic catalog.

deprecated: Use dc2_truth_run1.2_galaxies instead.
