  Cluster and member catalogs computed from the redMaPPer cluster finder
  (v0.8.1) and run on run2.2i DR6.  The red-sequence calibration was
  performed with extra terms to account for the underestimation of color
  errors from the cmodel fluxes.  This catalog can be compared to the
  cosmoDC2_v1.1.4_redmapper_v0.8.1 catalog.
