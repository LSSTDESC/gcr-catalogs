    DC2 Run 2.1i DR1(b) Object Catalog with photo-z, for tract 3830 only

    A composite catalog that matches the base run2.1i catalog with photometric
    redshift estimates for every object. Note that the grid points on which the
    redshift PDF is evaluated on are stored as photoz_pdf_bin_centers. The
    photoz PDF estimates are run on 0<z<3.
