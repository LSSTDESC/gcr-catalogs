     Composite catalog that matches the "observed" photometry catalog for
     cosmoDC2_v1.1.4_image (see column directly above) with photometric
     redshift estimates. Caveat: only a subset of the objects, those with
     scatmag_i<26.5, have photometric redshift estimates. The composite catalog
     will return masked arrays that must have the mask applied if you wish to
     properly extract both magnitudes and photometric redshifts simultaneously.

     Data used for training BPZ is representative down to scatmag_i < 25.
