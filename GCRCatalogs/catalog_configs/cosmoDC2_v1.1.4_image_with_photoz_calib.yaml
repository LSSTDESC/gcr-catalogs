description: |
    Catalog containing boolean columns indetifying objects as DESI-like QSOs,
    LRGs, ELGs, or a magnitude limited sample. Selections are made on the
    cosmosDC2 truth information in both magnitude and galaxy properties.
    All samples are selected to be independent. See
    http://github.com/LSSTDESC/pz_calibrate/docs/notebooks/CreateGCRFiles.ipynb

    The samples are selected follows:
    OSOs : 19.5 < mag_r < 23.4, highest value of `blackHoleMass` *
           `blackHoleEddingtonRatio` until the target DESI density is met.
    ELGs : 19.5 < mag_r < 23.4, highest value of `totalStarFormationRate` until
           target DESI density is met and is also not selected as a QSO.
    LRGs : 19.5  < mag_r, mag_z < 23.0, highest value of `stellar_mass` until
           target DESI density is met. Must also not be OSO or ELG.
    MagLim : mag_r < 19.5
    AllReferences : Union of above selections.
